# MSAuth [UNDER DEVELOPMENT]

To understand key concepts of CLEAN architecture, Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Dependency Injection, Outbox patterns using Hangfire, and Microservices, I've developed MSAuth (Authentication Microservice). The goal is to create a service that can be easily consumed by other services.

This microservice enables the creation of apps, each with its unique app key, which allows them to manage user creation and authentication.
